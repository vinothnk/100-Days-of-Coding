# Instructions
# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result.
# This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.
#
# DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
# Write your 1 line code ğŸ‘‡ below:

result = [number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0]


# Write your code ğŸ‘† above:

print(result)
